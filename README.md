# Mastering JavaScript

> *"There is no limit for perfection"*

This repository of mine is dedicated to practicing (and preaching) the exercises from the [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) book. This plain question below might have immediately struck your mind: 

- "Why would you start reading it whilst completing Scrimba's Front End Career Path which has a whole module dedicated to JS?"

Simply put, Scrimba being the "workhorse" of my learning, at times I felt like I lack concrete maths-style theoretical definitions, **the source of truth**.

While high-quality, techical and succinct [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) do serve the purpose, I was looking for a more beginner-friendly reference, as well as more elaborate — and **I think I found it**.
